More decoupled code
Inject dependency instead of using concrete object
With DI we depend on abstraction not on concrete implementationÐ—

Advantages of DI reduce boilerplate code, more decoupled, high abstraction

                --> Constructor BEST Option, guarantee that all dependency will be there when we create the object
3 types of DI   --> Setter When dependency is not a must and is optional
                --> Fields Object may not be created or can be null

Inversion of control transfers the control of the object or portions of program to a framework.
